# Rust Traffic Simulator

## Intro

This is a fun ongoing side-project I decided to make to learn more about the Rust language.

The project simulates cars on generated roads that find paths to destinations using the A* algorithm, sort of in a manner similar to [Mini Motorways](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOo64IKK00g&t=1s) without the visual flare (yet!)

## Purpose

fun.

In reality, keeping up with this project gives me something to do between semesters, and I have also learned and hope to continue learning common Rust patterns and all the fun little quirks of the language (damn you borrow checker...)

## Intent

I dont intend on making this anything more than a fun simulation to play with. Near the end of getting the logic sorted out however, I do intend to add some more elements that allow the user to interact with the simulation a bit more interactively, such as:

- adding obstructions and new roads
- some sort of optional directive like Mini Motorways that requires a dynamically changing area based on new demands of cars and routes.
